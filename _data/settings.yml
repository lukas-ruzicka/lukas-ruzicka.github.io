He was our iOS tech guru and author of many internal libraries and architecture patterns, that we use on our projects today.

    content: "From the beginning of our cooperation about 4 years ago, Lukáš was one of the most helpful and supportive colleagues on the team. He guided me in my first steps in Synetech and also in Synetech's biggest project, on which we worked together. It was an honor to work with Lukáš and see him grow in both technical and soft skills. He is always open to finding out ways to improve himself as well as the well-being of the whole team. Besides being a great iOS engineer, who is able to cope with any technical challenge, he is also experienced in managerial roles as he can find the balance between the needs of the company and the iOS team and be a great delegate for the team."

During the year we worked together, he not only delivered high quality software, but he was also always there to help others with everything from pair programming to discussing technical solutions and team improvements. He is a strong team player and someone I could trust and count on. I'm happy that I got to know him, and I'm sure he will do great in his upcoming adventures!"
