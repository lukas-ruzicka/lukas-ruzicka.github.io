title: About me
description: I'm (still 😁) a young lad born in north Bohemia (Most) who moved to Prague to study at university and eventually built a career as developer here. Here I'd like to tell you more about my passions and motivations.

Of course, I have to start with my passion for programming. As a kid I was always curious about how things worked and once I found out that I could actually be the one to bring these things to live, this world completely consumed me. 

> The IT industry is full of ethusiastic people - tuning into the wave and sharing the passion is something I never get tired of 💜

I know that being a developer is a never-ending learning process, and that's one of the main reasons I'm glad I chose this path. It's just great to always be able to look back and really see the progress behind me and always have the feeling of growth.

Anyway, there's a lot of talk about my programming hobby (all the remainings of the website actually 😅), so let's get to more personal stuff.

I have a dog 🐕 and I love spending time outdoors. It's alwasy great to go for a long walk and calm all the thoughts in my head 😌.

I love all kinds of motorsport 🏎, but I enjoy Formula 1 (as a fan) and karting (as a racer) the most. I actively participate in the [Sodi World Series](https://www.sodiwseries.com/) rental kart championship.

Last but not least, I try to be aware of my body and both physical and mental care. In addition to active workouts and running, I also dedicate myself to hacking my body and mind to be better every day. I also love extreme outdoor races, such as the [Spartan race](https://www.spartan.com), where I can really push my performance to the absolute limit.
