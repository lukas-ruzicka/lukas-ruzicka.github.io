description: Having worked on various projects, my experiences are quite broad (within the iOS platform). These are some of my experiences, skills and interests - overall, we can call it my tech stack.

> It's pretty obvious, but my language of choice is, of course, **Swift** 🧡

## 👨🏽‍💻 Software

Well, I guess these things are pretty fundamental to any iOS developer, but I get along well with:
- macOS
- Xcode & its additional tools
- Terminal
- and a lots of other tools that help make my work more effective 😎

## 🕹️ Version control

Is anyone using anything other than `git` nowadays? 😅 I'm also pretty familiar with rebasing and keeping a clean history.


## 📱 User Interface

Currently, I mainly use **`SwiftUI`**, but I still have a lot of experience with `UIKit` - especially in the programmatic form (using [Stevia framework](https://github.com/freshOS/Stevia))

> I'm quite aware that we all need to know `UIKit` as well as there's still a lot that `SwiftUI` doesn't cover 🥲


## ⏳ Asynchronous programming

Glad to be able to use the nicely readable **Swift concurrency** (`async/await`), but also have broad experience with reactive frameworks - worked for years with [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and then with `Combine` (mostly before the Swift concurrency came).


## 🏛 Architectures

Have participated in introducing of own architecture (in SYNETECH) based on the **clean architecture** with modular presentation modules mainly inspired by **VIPER**. The architecture was quite robust, as the intention was to have one architecture for all types of projects that we've worked on in the company.

> Have described the advantages of the clean architecture in the mobile apps environment in the article [_Example usage of the clean architecture_](blog/clean-architecture-example).

Used the [Swinject framework](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) for dependency injection 💉, but also have tried (and probably liked more) a more lighterweight framework [Resolver](https://github.com/hmlongco/Resolver).


## 🌐 Networking

Used to work mainly with [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), but lately have been using the `URLSession` more.

For analysis and debugging I use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com) and [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io).

## 🏪 App Store

Have quite some experience with app signing and release process. Also worked with in-app purchases, but I wouldn't call myself an expert in that area.

## 👷🏼‍♂️ Code management

- use [Tuist](https://tuist.io) to manage Xcode projects
- Swift packages for dependency management (previously worked with CocoaPods)
- have some experience with CI/CD (on GitLab and GitHub)

## 🧙🏼‍♂️ Augmented reality

I'm very interested in augmented reality (the ARKit and RealityKit frameworks in the context of Apple) and already have experience with several AR projects.

> You can find a few examples of my work with augmented reality in the [_References_](../work/): [AppParade AR zone](../work/appparade-ar-zone), [Festival Svobody](../work/festival-svobody) or R&D project [SYNEVision](../work/synevision)
