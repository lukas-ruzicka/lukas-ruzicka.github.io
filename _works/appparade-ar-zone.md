SYNETECH tried to revive an app competition called [AppParade](https://appparade.cz), so they bought the brand and organized several new editions of the event. I came up with the idea of adding a zone where we could showcase our tech skills and demonstrate the capabilities of emerging technologies - the augmented reality was a perfect fit in this case.

> All projects were conceived, researched and developed by me.

The first zone was a room with an empty table where you could play a multiplayer game where you destroyed your opponent's block castles by firing a slingshot. The game was inspired by a [similar game that Apple has shown at WWDC 2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17426880/apple-ar-kit-2-multiplayer-competitive-game-swift-shot).

The next event, we decided to show the possibility of extending a real static picture with a continuation in a form of a video, which is presented virtually over the real picture (the idea was to have the real picture blend seamlessly with the video). You can think of it like the idea of a newspaper from the Harry Potter movies.

The last project was the realization of the concept of the museum of the future, where you don't have any information banners or other things that would spoil the exhibition, but only a clean and pure thing - the information content is then derived only virtually.

You can read more about the tech challenges during this project in my article [_Augmented Reality and its easier usage with iOS 13 and “Reality” tools? Not quite so..._](blog/ios13-reality-tools).
