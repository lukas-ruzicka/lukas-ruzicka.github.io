I've been exploring different areas of augmented reality possibilities in a mobile app for commercial purposes, such as extending physical catalogues with additional content and shopping options.

During the R&D, I've built couple of internal frameworks that focused mainly on augmenting physical 2D (images, catalogue pages etc.) and 3D objects with info panels, music, videos and other content.

> The use of the concepts explored within this initiative can be seen in other projects I have worked on, such as [App Parade AR zone](appparade-ar-zone) or [Festival Svobody](festival-svobody).
