I was responsible for the entire development of the iOS app. It was our first project using SwiftUI, so the project involved research and changes to our architecture.

> Interesting fact: The airplane animation that is executed during scrolling on the flight detail screen was my idea. I've quite enjoyed that as it was relatively easy thanks to the SwiftUI framework üòÅ.

As I mentioned in the beginning, we were using SwiftUI and I had to modify our architecture to make it work well with the different framework. Also, I switched _RxSwift_ for _Combine_ for the data flow handling there. The project was partly experimental for us (from a technical point of view), but I think we managed it well in the end (and the app looks really cool, imho üòé).
