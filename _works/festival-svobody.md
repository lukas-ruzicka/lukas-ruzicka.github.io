We worked on the whole event app in SYNETECH, but I was mainly responsible for the augmented reality module, which was to allow real images from the exhibition to be enriched with videos. You can see the result in the following videos.

> The best aspect of this work was that it had a real impact on an educational environment and really helped the students learn more about the history of our country.
