I've been leading the iOS team for almost a year and a half and have gained a lot of experience during that time. The team size was between 5 and 8 people working on different projects within the company.

As the company's principles of work were facing towards the goal of becoming a [Teal Organization](https://workology.com/what-is-a-teal-organization/) with holocratic principles, my role as a team leader was **more representative and strategic than managerial** as the right to make decisions was always in the hands of the whole team. The role was **focused mainly on leadership and facilitating all information flow** - in other words: ensuring that everyone was informed of everything they needed to and providing context for any decisions that had to be made.

> In our internal jargon, the role was called _the House of iOS Lead ðŸ‘‘_

There was also the aforementioned strategic component, as I had to **plan the capacities (co-operation with project planning and hiring)** and **organize the distribution of knowledge within the team** - i.e.  putting together the right pairs of trainee-mentor or assigning the right code reviewer for each of us. I've tried to **work with each team member's individual motivations** and talk to them regularly about their desires and future prospects, but also went through things like 360Â° feedback to try to find areas where they can improve and help them find steps to do so.

Given that the company was going through a transformation to the advanced holocratic system, it was quite challenging to get things right and required creating a few systems on the fly ðŸ˜…. But I personally think that I managed to get it right and performed the role correctly. You can also see in [the Recommendation section on the homepage](https://lukas.ruzicka.io) that the feedback on my work within this role has been positive.
